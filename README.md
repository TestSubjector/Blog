# Welcome to Antithetical Parallels

Using Github Pages to blog about my projects, as long as my willpower doesn't go AFK (tryNumber = 3).

* Made a Github Page after a lot of back and forth head-scratching. I know, I know, should have just learned HTML and made a proper website. But I feel comfortable with the simplicity of it now. So it will stay like this for the foreseeable future.
