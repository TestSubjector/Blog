Well, there's not much of a Pi day celeberation (or even mention) on our side of the world.<br/>
That's simply because we go for a DD/MM format rather than peculiar MM/DD format, for dates.<br/>
There's a small irony here, in the sense that the dates for these posts require a YYYY-MM-DD format.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I've caved into giving an option for comments on all my posts ([guidance taken from here](https://60devs.com/adding-comments-to-your-jekyll-blog.html)). I'm sure this'll go swimmingly. Pretty sure.
