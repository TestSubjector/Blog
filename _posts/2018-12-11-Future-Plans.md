The movie trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 just came out. Saying it with brevity, it is such a beautiful capstone to the monument of memories the series has been, to so many people. Find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16N6IkhxprE).

**This post is kinda of an important marker-type post, so please bear with the different pacing.**  
  
&nbsp;

My 4-1 semester is at an end.  
Some of the people I know actually took the option of early graduation, for them their college life will end in just a few days.  
Many of my friends will leave/have left the campus. They'll undergo their last few months of college working, in short, *"at some company, at some place"*.  
Me? Due to the perks of taking two degrees and receiving an on-campus thesis offer (and cause of a tiny problem), I potentially see myself staying here for another 2 years. 
Oh boy!  
  
So, that's a lot of time.  
To do a lot of things.  
Or just waste in its entirety.  
To do the former and not the latter, is what I perceive this blog can help me with.  
Which is why I'm here.  
  

&nbsp;

Speaking freely, I can potentially have to construct deep differential equations, write machine learning code in Julia, for aerodynamic simulations, compete in BattleCode, play and become a pro at Artifact, work on AI problems, help create video animations, publish papers and earn money.  
These objectives/goals are lofty.  
It's just that I don't have much do otherwise now. So why not?  

Also, I went through some of the previous posts; agonized over the silly mistakes made (some were fixed); looked critically at the UI of the site (I dont care what you say, it's perfect I tell ya) and hope to make a lot of posts with stellar content for the future.  

Sigh, this is hard.
