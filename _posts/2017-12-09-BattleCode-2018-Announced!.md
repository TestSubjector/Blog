You heard it right folks, the greatest college-level AI competition will start its annual cycle in January 2018, hosted by MIT. I'll be properly participating in it for the first time and I'm pretty hyped about it. Do have a look at their [main site](https://www.battlecode.org), since it will do a better job than me of explaining what BattleCode is.  
  
Do participate if you can, its gonna be one heck of a ride.
