You heard it right folks, the greatest college-level AI competition will start its annual cycle in January 2018. I'll be properly participating in it for the first time and I'm pretty hyped about it. Do have a look at their [main site](https://www.battlecode.org), since it will do a better job than me of explaining what BattleCode is.  
  
Do participate if you can, its gonna be one heck of a ride.
