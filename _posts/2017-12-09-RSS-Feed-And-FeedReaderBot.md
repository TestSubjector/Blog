----------------
[RSS Feed(s)](https://testsubjector.github.io/feed.xml) is/(are?) now enabled (if they weren't already automatically done by Github Pages).  

This is a good opportunity to talk about a bot, [Feed Reader Bot](https://storebot.me/bot/thefeedreaderbot)* for the popular messaging app [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org).  
  

What this gives you is a separate chat room for all the interesting feeds you want to go through in one place. So essentially you get notifications when your favourite podcasts, news or game website or even a comic strip site has a new post.  
And with the [Instant View](https://instantview.telegram.org/) feature of Telegram, you get go through a very light-weight no-nonsense view of the stuff that you want to see. A good way to keep track of the thing you want to see.  

**The author is in no way affiliated with the Bot, except being a happy user of its free version.*
