So how are you doing? Great? I hope so, because everything is sunny and cheery for the author currently.

My [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5088075618189312) got selected for OpenAstronomy, Google Summer of Code 2017!
The effort put in the previous two months paid off. Really glad for that.

Now, as a student under OpenAstronomy I'm supposed to blog every two weeks on the work I've done and the current status of my project.
This will hosted on the OpenAstronomy [website](http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/).

I've chosen to host these GSoC specific posts on Medium, because setting up category specific RSS-feeds on Github pages is a bit of a pain.
And Medium is more visually appealing, of course.

Find them [here](https://medium.com/@prasunk2).

But don't be so quick to leave this small blog, fellow non-existent reader!
I'll be still posting content(hopefully) not directly related to my project here.
