I'll start by clearly stating that this is not an April Fools post, despite the day it's being posted on.

Our work in collaboration with [Prof. S.M. Deshpande](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=AUM8IXYAAAAJ&hl=en) and NVIDIA has been accepted for a talk at NVIDIA's GTC 2021 conference, being held from 12-16th April.

The title of the talk is "On the Performance of GPU-Accelerated Meshfree Solvers in Fortran, C++, Python, and Julia". It will be recorded video-on-demand (VOD) talk 
and everyone can register for free, for the conference and view the talk [linked here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s31311/) on 12th April, 10 AM (UTC-7).

In summary, it will be regarding benchmarks performed to assess and compare the computational efficiency and the relative performance of meshfree solvers based on the Least Squares Kinetic Upwind Method for inviscid compressible flows. The GPU solvers being benchmarked have been written in Fortran 90, C++, Python and the Julia programming languages.
