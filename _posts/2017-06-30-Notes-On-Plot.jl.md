I've started using the Julia plotting library [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) as a part of my summer internship at the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa where I'm working on the [Autonomous Vertical Profiler](http://www.nio.org/index/option/com_subcategory/task/show/title/Autonomous%20Verticle%20Profiler/tid/2/sid/134/thid/168) and the data gathered by it.

Below are a few notes I made about a few things I noticed while using the library.

*Work In Progress*
