Whelp, this Github_page-blog-website chimera completely (or conveniently) 
slipped from my mind. However, now that I'm delving properly into the fields
of Computer Science that I've dreamed about as a kid (stay tuned!); this seems like the perfect place to record those experiences*.  
  
`*I plan to use Medium for the things that should ideally be targeted for mass audiences. This bare-bones-but-beautiful blog isn't suited for that kind of aim. But I'll keep a record of links of all such posts here.`   
  
Let's make good on the above decision right now! [Here's my post on the whole GSoC experience
(in Medium of course).](https://medium.com/@prasunk2/and-so-the-curtain-falls-on-this-gsoc-journey-69f1e4d0e4ca)  
  
Finally, all that has been said in this post has been said under the assumption of a sustained motivation cycle. If the chimera goes dark, you know what happened.
