> Well, it's madness season again.
> When people who you never thought would give a damn about programming, will start acting if that has been there lifelong ambition. 

> Yeah, the topic in question is Google Summer of Code 2017. 
> For the uninitiated, you can know more about it here - https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/

> The idea is simple essentially,
> Google in it's quest to promote [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) will pay you a stipend to work in an organisation under this GSoC program.
> Open to university students, you code away in your summer vacations, and if the performance is satisfactory, you recieve a stipend based on *your country*. 

> Now some people have a negative view of this whole...*festival*, with the reason being that they percieve the motivation to monetary.
> I don't want to go much into that, but from what I see, monetary motivation has been an accepted motivator throughout all disciplines and arts that exist.
> And several past GSoC-ers have become integral members for the organisation they had had mentored under.

> Or more succinctly put, what better way is there to attact overworked always-broke college students to open source?

> Anyway, I think I'll have a go at it this year. 
> The organization that I'll try for will most probably be Chapel, a parallel programming language whose development is lead by [Cray Inc](http://www.cray.com/)
> Why Chapel? Well, the organization has been floating around the back of my head since GSoC 2016. And I recently got a project under a professor to make a proof of concept image-encrypter in Chapel. 
> So that's a win-win situation for me.

> But that's not all of the reason, right?
> Yeap, you got it. The answer is...
> POWER!!! UNLIMITED... POWER!!!

> *cough*

> There is a [chapter](http://chapel.cray.com/publications/PMfPC-Chapel.pdf) in Programming Models for Parallel Computing, MIT Press which is on the Chael language (stumbled on it from the Chapel website).
> It describes in brief, the histroy of Chapel, the ideas and design decisions and the also the ideals behind the language (plus a convienient tutorial to the language)
> Going through it, I felt like I wanted to associate with this. It's not a world-breaking motivator, but hey! It's a motivator nonetheless.

> Here's hoping for the best.
