  <h1>A Question Of Nature</h1>
<p class="meta">03 Mar 2017</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>“What is Nature?” one may ask.<br />
The sun and the moon in their eternal dance,<br />
The bountiful green in a sea of grass,<br />
Or a flash of flowers,<br />
Their colours (colors?) bright and fast.</p>

<p>Is it the brotherhood of silent trees?<br />
Sheltering any creature, demanding no fee.<br />
The old mountains, keeping their silent watches,<br />
These gray-beards, that see the coming and going of ages.</p>

<p>The youthful rivers, with their joys and pace,<br />
Running on and on till they reach their mother’s embrace.<br />
Or perhaps it’s the birds, the beasts and the bees,<br />
Variety as boundless as the sea.</p>

<p>Nature is whatever there is to see,<br />
What has come and what is to be.<br />
Nature is everything, leaving nothing else to say,<br />
So protect it, to see the glimpse of another day.</p>
