<div class="post">
  <p>Another very late post, I know.</p>

<p>So, Team #369 - Markov Chain Gang, secured a position in the top 8-12th bracket of the International Qualifying bracket of BattleCode 2018.<br>
We had a really good chance of getting a place in the Finals (&amp; a trip to MIT!), if not for some of these reasons -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two (out of 4) of our team members got bogged down with other college related activities. So it ended with me and <a href="https://github.com/legobridge" class="user-mention">@legobridge</a>
carrying the team.</li>
  <li>Docker problems plagued me throughout the tournament. I lost 3-4 days cumulative in patching, updating, clearing, removing, re-installing docker to run the BattleCode scaffold.</li>
  <li>A quota of max 4 International teams for the finals (out of the total 16 spots) was implemented for this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very honestly, it was the last point that hurt the most. The International teams were as a whole, way more competitive and most of the top positions in the daily scrimmage rankings were captured by these teams. I understand the reason why it was done (last year had almost nil local presence) but I can’t help feel a bit salty. That’s because despite the other problems, we had a good chance of getting into the Finals, if not for the quota.</p>

<p>Sigh, quotas are a sticky, volatile and frustrating point for many Indians like in me in general.
However, I can’t deny that the experience was lovely. Every single part of it, from regularly coding upto 20 hours at a stretch, the fun discussions on Twitch and the strategies and plans hatched and abandoned; it’s something I’ll definetly want to do again next year too.</p>

<p>Just no Docker again, please.</p>
