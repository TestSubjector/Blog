  <hr />
<p>The movie trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 just came out. Saying it with brevity, it is such a beautiful capstone to the monument of memories the series has been, to so many people. Find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16N6IkhxprE">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This post is kinda of an important marker-type post, so please bear with the different pacing.</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My 4-1 semester is at an end.
Some of the people I know actually took the option of early graduation, for them their college life will end in just a few days.
Many of my friends will leave/have left the campus. They’ll undergo their last few months of college working, in short, <em>“at some company, at some place”</em>.
Me? Due to the perks of taking two degrees and receiving an on-campus thesis offer (and cause of a tiny problem), I potentially see myself staying here for another 2 years.
Oh boy!</p>

<p>So, that’s a lot of time.
To do a lot of things.
Or just waste in its entirety.
To do the former and not the latter, is what I perceive this blog can help me with.
Which is why I’m here.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Speaking freely, I can potentially have to construct deep differential equations, write machine learning code in Julia for aerodynamic simulations, compete in BattleCode, play and become a pro at Artifact, work on AI problems, help create video animations, publish papers and earn money.
These objectives/goals are lofty.
It’s just that I don’t have much do otherwise now. So why not?</p>

<p>Also, I went through some of the previous posts; agonized over the silly mistakes made (some were fixed); looked critically at the UI of the site (I don’t care what you say, it’s perfect I tell ya) and hope to make a lot of posts with stellar content for the future.</p>

<p>Sigh, this is hard.</p>
