<h1>To GSoc Or Not To GSoC</h1>

  <p>Well, it’s madness season again.</p>

<p>When people who you never thought would give a damn about programming, will start acting if that has been there lifelong ambition.</p>

<p>Yeah, the topic in question is Google Summer of Code 2017.
For the uninitiated, you can know more about it <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is simple essentially,
Google in its quest to promote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source software</a> will pay you a stipend to work in an organisation under the GSoC program.</p>

<p>Open to all university students, you code away your summer vacations, and if the performance is satisfactory, you receive a stipend based on <em>your country</em> at the end.</p>

<p>Now some people have a negative view of this whole…<em>festival</em>, with the reason being that they perceive the motivation to monetary.</p>

<p>I don’t want to go much into that, but from what I see, monetary motivation has been an accepted motivator throughout all disciplines and arts that exist.
And several past GSoC-ers have become integral members, for the organisation they had had mentored under.</p>

<p>Perhaps more succinctly put, what better way is there to attract overworked always-broke college students to the world of open source?</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I’ll have a go at it this year.
The organization that I’ll try for will most probably be Chapel, a parallel programming language whose development is lead by <a href="http://www.cray.com/">Cray Inc</a>.</p>

<p>Why Chapel? Well, the organization has been floating around the back of my head since GSoC 2016. And I recently got a project under a professor to make a proof of concept image-encrypter in Chapel.
So that’s a win-win situation for me.</p>

<p>But that’s not all of the reason, right?
Yeap, you got it. The answer is…</p>

<p>POWER!!! UNLIMITED… POWER!!!</p>

<p><em>cough</em> <em>cough</em></p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/publications/PMfPC-Chapel.pdf">chapter</a> in Programming Models for Parallel Computing, MIT Press which is on the Chapel language (stumbled on it from the Chapel website).</p>

<p>It describes in brief, the history of Chapel, the ideas and design decisions and the also the ideals behind the language (plus a convenient tutorial to the language).
Going through it, I felt like I wanted to associate with this. It’s not a world-breaking motivator, but hey! It’s a motivator nonetheless.
Although,I’ll see if any other organization matches my interest or not.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping for the best.</p>
