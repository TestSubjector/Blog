			<h1>Salutations</h1>
			<p> I'm using Github Pages to blog about my projects, poetry and whatnot. Unfortunately, experience has told me it takes me just too
				much time to be able to write a proper post. So expect large periods of silence or even complete abandonment at any point of time.
				<br></br>
				Don't be confused by the simple layout. It's a feature.

    <h5 class="page__title">Recent Posts</h5>

      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a> &raquo; <span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span></li>
		{% endfor %}
