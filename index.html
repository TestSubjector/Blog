	<p> I'm using Github Pages to blog about my projects, poetry and whatnot. Unfortunately, experience has told me it takes me just too
		much time to be able to write a proper post. So expect large periods of silence or even complete abandonment at any point of time.
		<br></br>
		Don't be confused by the simple layout. It's a feature.
