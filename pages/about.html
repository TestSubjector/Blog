Currently, I've graduated with a Masters in Computer Science degree from NYU Courant. <br>
Previously I was a Junior Software Developer under <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/nanil/Profile"> Dr. N. Anil. </a> <br>
If I had to highlight some of my interests they'll be working on GPU Optimisations, Backend Development & 
Game Development among other things.
